What are programs?
A computer program is a structured set of instructions written to perform specific operations on a computer. These instructions are created using programming languages and are executed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU). Programs serve as the backbone of modern computing, enabling automation, data processing, communication, and entertainment.


Characteristics of a Program:

1. Purposeful: Every program is designed to achieve specific tasks or solve problems.

2. Structured: Programs are organized logically, often using functions, loops, and conditional statements.

3. Interactive: Many programs respond to user inputs and adapt their behavior accordingly.


Types of Programs

1. System Software
System software manages hardware and provides foundational services for other software. Without system software, computers cannot function.
Examples:

Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android manage resources like memory and processing power.

Device Drivers: Software that allows the operating system to communicate with hardware devices like printers or graphics cards.

2. Application Software
Application software is designed to help users perform tasks. These programs often have a user-friendly interface and specific functionality.
Examples:

Productivity Tools: Microsoft Office, Google Docs.

Web Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.

Creative Software: Adobe Photoshop, Final Cut Pro.

3. Utility Software
Utility software focuses on system maintenance and optimization. These programs ensure the computer runs efficiently.
Examples:

Antivirus tools like Norton and McAfee.

Disk management software like CCleaner.

4. Programming Software
These tools are used to create other programs and applications. They are essential for software development.
Examples:

Text Editors: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text.

Compilers: GCC, LLVM.

Debuggers: Tools that help identify errors in code.

How Programs Work
Programs are written in high-level programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++). The development process involves multiple steps to transform human-readable code into machine-executable instructions.

Steps in Program Execution:

1. Writing Code: Developers write source code using programming languages.

2. Compilation or Interpretation:

Compiled Languages (e.g., C++): The code is translated into machine code before execution.

Interpreted Languages (e.g., Python): The code is executed line by line during runtime.

3. Execution: The CPU processes the machine code and performs the specified operations.

Core Components of a Program:

Input: Data provided to the program by the user or environment.

Processing: The logic defined in the program to manipulate input data.

Output: The result or feedback produced by the program.
