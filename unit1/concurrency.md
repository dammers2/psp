Concurrency is the ability to execute multiple tasks at the same time, optimizing the use of system resources.
This is achieved through processes, which are independent instances of a program with their own memory, and threads, which are lighter subprocesses within a single process that share memory.

There are three main ways to implement concurrency:

-Multithreading: Using multiple threads within a process.
-Multiprocessing: Executing multiple processes in parallel.
-Asynchronous programming: Tasks that do not block the main flow, ideal for input/output operations.

However, working with concurrency can lead to issues such as:

-Conflicts from simultaneous access to shared resources.
-Deadlocks, where processes block each other while waiting for resources.
-Starvation, where a process never gains access to resources.
-Data inconsistencies caused by uncontrolled shared access.

To manage concurrency, tools like mutexes, monitors (which combine mutual exclusion and conditions), and message queues for process communication are used. Additionally, functional programming reduces synchronization problems by avoiding the modification of shared data.
Many technologies support concurrency, such as the threading and asyncio libraries in Python, coroutines in Kotlin, or the actor model in frameworks like Akka. This concept is key in modern applications such as web servers, operating systems, databases, and network applications, where handling multiple tasks or users simultaneously is essential.
