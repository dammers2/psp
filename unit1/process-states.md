Process states refers to the life cycle of processes managed by the operating system or how services or processes interact with other system components.
System services: The services running in the background, like daemons in Linux, have states similar to those of operating system processes.

States in Middleware or Concurrency Frameworks:
In languages like Java, Phyton or C#, threads and processes also have states managed by libraries or frameworks.
Event Based Systems:
Systems using paradigms like reactive programming have similar states. For instance, services waiting for events can be considered blocked until the event occurs.
Distributed Applications:
In distributed systems, processes on different nodes may have synchronized or asynchronous execution states, requiring explicit management of the process or service
lifecyle.

Practical Application in Programming
Launching and managing processes:
Using libraries or commands like fork in C or modules like subprocess in Phyton to launch processes and control their states.
Controlling states:
Programming logic to react to process states, such as retrying blocked processes or handling terminated processes.
Optimization and diagnosis:
Identifying states where a service gets stuck (such as blocked) and optimizing it to avoid bottlenecks.
