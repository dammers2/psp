# Process States

Process states refer to the life cycle of processes managed by the operating system or how services or processes interact with other system components.

### System Services
The services running in the background, like daemons in Linux, have states similar to those of operating system processes.

## States in Middleware or Concurrency Frameworks

### Languages and Frameworks
In languages like **Java**, **Python**, or **C#**, threads and processes also have states managed by libraries or frameworks.

### Event-Based Systems
Systems using paradigms like reactive programming have similar states. For instance, services waiting for events can be considered **blocked** until the event occurs.

### Distributed Applications
In distributed systems, processes on different nodes may have synchronized or asynchronous execution states, requiring explicit management of the process or service lifecycle.

## Practical Application in Programming

### Launching and Managing Processes
Using libraries or commands like `fork` in **C** or modules like `subprocess` in **Python** to launch processes and control their states.

### Controlling States
Programming logic to react to process states, such as:
- Retrying blocked processes.
- Handling terminated processes.

### Optimization and Diagnosis
Identifying states where a service gets stuck (such as **blocked**) and optimizing it to avoid bottlenecks.

### Priority Scheduling
Processes are assigned a priority, and the scheduler selects the highest-priority process for execution, mitigating starvation with techniques like aging.

### Round-Robin
A time-sharing algorithm cycling through processes in a circular queue, allocating a fixed time slice to ensure fairness.
