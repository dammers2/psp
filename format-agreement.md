# **Main title of your topic**
  
Here we'll explain in a few words our topic, definition. Then we will divide the main content into sections.  
To separate, we will use "---" before starting to work on our file.

## First title
  
Here will be the full explanation of our topic, but donâ€™t cram it all together, please.  
  
If you need to divide information, add sub-titles (#).  
Then we will explain sub-topics here. If you need to divide it more, just add more hashes (##).
  
As a curiosity, you will need to double-space if you want to skip a line and keep writing down; that way, you will create a paragraph break.
  
### Second title
  
As if they were titles in HTML, just keep adding hashes as needed. Each hash will make the title smaller.
  
```
Example in HTML:

<h1>Main title</h1>
<h2>First title</h2>
<h3>Second title</h3>

Example in Markdown:

# Main title
## First title
### Second title
```

### In case we need to add blocks of code use this format, it will be easier to copy later:

```
let message = 'Hello world';
alert(message);
```

### Links

For next jobs, we will maybe have to include links to websites, videos or simply any other pull request
  
You may be using [This Format](https://www.educa2.madrid.org/web/centro.ies.islasfilipinas.madrid).

Eventually, although we can already see the authors, it would be good to 'sign' our project at the very end.
  
Also including bibliographic details.
